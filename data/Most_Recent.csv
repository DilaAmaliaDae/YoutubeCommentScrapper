Upper days, I supersetted 5 sets of 10 pull-ups and dips (bodyweight). Lower days, I did 5 sets of 10 hanging leg raises. I did no other assistance work than that. There should be a link to the program in the video description. 		0	2013-07-20T13:31:39.000Z

I haven't been following BJJ or MMA very much lately. You know I do no-go, but I still really like the 10th Planet style because, even though they wear gi bottoms, it is suited to my personal style--I play from my back and rarely try for mount. I like GSP, of course. He is well rounded and classy. Chael Sonnen is entertaining. Jon Jones is extremely unorthodox and fun to watch. I'm tired of Anderson Silva, but probably just because he is so good. ;-) 		0	2013-03-07T18:11:16.000Z

I think the 3-Month Challenge version is superior to the regular Boring But Big template because it hits all of the lifts twice per week with increasing percentages for assistance lifts--just my opinion, though. People lift with different goals in mind, so I say do what works for you. This is working for me: I'm staying small while getting stronger. And once I start posting my MMA training and BJJ competition, people will see why I want to stay small while getting stronger.		0	2013-03-07T15:36:01.000Z

You CAN gain strength on a caloric deficit. Small and strong is my goal right now. Not sure where my bf% is right now. 12%, maybe? Or slightly less--11.5%? Haven't checked in a while.

The reason you can lift more weight with mixed grip (you'll notice I switched to mixed grip for the 400-lb pull) is that it requires less grip strength. I switched to double-overhand grip 3 months ago when I started 531 to work on that grip strength for BJJ. Before that, I had never pulled double overhand.		0	2013-03-07T13:49:42.000Z

It takes a couple of weeks to get used to it. My shoulder mobility was bad and I cramped up (back and shoulders) a lot when I first started low bar squatting. However, when I got the technique down--maybe two to three weeks to get comfortable with it--I could instantly squat more weight. Tomorrow when I film my squat day, I'll try to focus on bar placement in the shots and narration."		0	2013-03-21T14:04:34.000Z

Just wanted to make sure it got there. I get 3 - 5 reps on weeks one and two, not to mention the 5 sets of 10 at 50%, 60%, and 70%. I feel like I need that 1 rep range more, as I am getting into 95% of my actual max and not the original training max. There is no way I could do 15 singles with 95% of any of my maxes. The point of the singles is so I can feel that true 95% more than I would be able to trying 1 set with multiple reps.		0	2013-05-02T18:14:07.000Z

I was 159 lbs about 3 and half weeks ago. I have increased calories slightly to help with my bench press. 1800 - 2000 is where I cut, 2000 - 2200 is where I maintain, and 2200 - 2500 is where I bulk--over the past 6 months, at least. These numbers could always change going forward, but we'll see.		0	2013-04-30T15:18:04.000Z

Did it for 8 weeks but definitely lost some strength in the gym during that time, think was on a too big of a deficit maybe, plus wasn't really working out to a set program and ceratinly not one tailored for making gains.

I do not believe a calorie surplus is necessary to build strength. I just wouldn't go into too large of a deficit. I have been below maintenance for the majority of the past 5 months on the program. If you saw my most recent 6-month transformation video--I dropped 40 lbs of fat. I'm around maintenance right now, but I don't count calories too closely. I just estimate. Same with macros. I do intermittent fasting, though.		0	2013-04-16T21:08:45.000Z

I have been doing this range of motion for several months and twice a week for the past two months with no issues. I'm happy with my should mobility for now, but I want to eventually try low bar squats. I will be switching to standard OH press either next cycle (two weeks from now) or the next 3-month rotation (a month and two weeks from now--which is more likely). I do foam roll and love it.

The range of motion(bar to neck)..Is deeper than you need or want to have..If I'm not mistaken you're going to move on to a differnt variation of overhead press? In order to achieve the mobility/flexability you seek in your shoulders/pecs(in a safer way) I recommend(if you don't already)foam rolling your thoracic spine,and doing bad dislocates(I did vid on them)I with vid a mob/flex upper body warm-up in the future		0	2013-01-29T15:57:23.000Z

With the setup in this video, I can't keep the bar placement consistent, so I meant to set traps first to keep the bar directly above my throat when racked. I set top first last Tuesday and the Tuesday before on my assistance work for OHP day. I don't know what happened today. I think the weight was messing with me.		0	2013-04-26T21:08:01.000Z

what my thoughts are..the arch is to save the elbows going way below 90 degrees..we agree on that..and infact Dave Tate speaks too the greater the angle then 90 degrees the more stress on shoulders...now Power-lifters as we all know have to touch the chest and pause in a meet...and even powerlifters train on pin/board presses which is a restricted ROM..

But even when I press light weight, I try to keep the explosiveness and expend maximum effort with same form. (I think Kyle Keough talks about that in one of his videos. Check him out if you haven't already subscribed to him.) But I usually do paused on light days and touch-and-go on heavy days. 		0	2013-04-01T13:52:23.000Z

I've been 160 - 163 lbs for about 10 weeks now.

What happened on your third rep is you pushed the bar towards your feet instead of infront of your face, it happens to me ALL the time and it pisses me off haha. I was told a long time ago that bench press is supposed to go in a straight line vertically but strength is better when I bench in a slight angle from my sternum to back over my face.

As for your back rounding, try setting up with you butt a little lower and a better arch in your lower back. That helps me when I feel my back is rounding a little more than I'd like.

Power cleans? Not optimal for you currently in my opinion. I don't implement it in my training either. It's too technical, having to learn the technique over a long time with a light weight at the proper starting position. First lifting session in 5 more days for me for the first time in over a month.		0	2013-04-05T16:23:24.000Z

The lifts are based on percentages of your max. Week one: 65%, 75%, 85%. Week two: 70%, 80%, 90%. Week three: 75%, 85%, 95%. Week four: 40%, 50%, 60%. So you end up ramping up to that 95% effort over three weeks. Then after the deload week you raise (or lower) your max based on how you did with 95%--at least, I do. So the short answer is I won't see 210 lbs again for a while.		0	2013-04-05T15:13:38.000Z

I was still 161 lbs the past three mornings. And all five of them felt fairly easy! I was so excited after this session, man. My bench has really improved over the course of this cycle. It's likely due to the fact that I set my assistance bench pressing on OHP day at 60%, 70%, and 80% and using the increased percentages on the first two sets for weeks 1 and 2. I'm still on the 2nd running of 3-month challenge version of boring but big.		0	2013-05-03T13:40:40.000Z

I never drug the bar into my shins on conventional deadlifts although I know some people do. I didn't need the socks until I switched to sumo deadlifts. On conventional deads, my shins touch the bar briefly during my initial knee drive but come away from the bar as I start the lift. The shin guards are going to force the bar an inch or so away from your shins anway, so just see what it feels like keeping the bar that far away from your shins during the lift.		0	2013-05-23T16:46:51.000Z

This asymetry of the shoulders (my right shoulder rolls forward) is something my chiropractor and I have been working on for a while. I hadn't realized that it was affecting my squatting, but now that you mention the issues showing mostly on the right side of my body, I realize that I am probably tilting the weight toward that side becasue of my right shoulder rotation. It's probably affecting my other lifts as well. I just recently started SMR. Will try the mini bands.		0	2013-01-19T20:28:41.000Z

For knee tracking, I'd recommend a combination of SMR on adductors, IT bands, and hip flexors, plus abductions/adductions. You could even wrap a short mini-band around your knees on the first set of BBB in order to have to work hard to keep your knees tracking above your feet. For your scapula, just start by seeing if you can be more mindful of retraction		0	2013-01-19T18:53:11.000Z

It looks like your right elbow it dipped lower as well, which is contributing to this. In short, work on tightening up your right scapula. The other issue here is inconsistent knee tracking; they're cow-hocked one-third through the concentric, and your right knee might be tracking in further than your left.		0	2013-01-19T18:49:46.000Z

I've just started going lighter on my MMA kettlebell and medicine ball routines so they don't interfere with my 531 lifting days. Give it three months. If you don't like it, do something else. Some people hate 531; others are fiercely loyal to it. I'm still in the middle but feel I will eventually fall into the latter camp.		0	2013-01-19T15:27:02.000Z

Deadlifting 225 lbs 50 times after squatting heavy--for me--is sick, brother! If you start 5/3/1 and you feel like you aren't getting a good workout, you've set your maxes too low; however, if you aren't hitting your reps, sets, and percentages, you've set your maxes too high. It may take a couple of weeks to find out exactly where your training maxes need to be.		0	2013-01-19T15:19:45.000Z

I like Boring But Big 3-Month Challenge because you do the major lifts twice a week. You can find the details through the link in my video descriptions. Wendler's philosophy on assistance work is that it shouldn't interfere with your major lifts and that you shouldn't do assistance work that doesn't directly support the major lifts.The major lifts make you bigger and stronger. Assistance work assists your being able to do the major lift better.		0	2013-01-19T15:11:39.000Z

I need to do more sumo deadlifts myself, it's a great lift! Also I'm gonna shoot for 420 on my next 1RM deadlift. I did 385 on my last 1 RM attempt and I feel like I could've gotten 400. I got a little ways to go to catch up to you. Good work!		0	2013-07-13T08:38:14.000Z

Changing your squatting makes sense since you have the meet coming up soon. Hopefully, it will translate into a higher max for you.

I like them so far. They give you a very stable base, which is their whole point. The heel lift allows you to hit better depth on squats. I haven't decided how I feel about them on the deadlift yet.		0	2013-06-18T13:33:09.000Z

I'm 160 lbs, so my 1RM of 225 is 1.4 times my bodyweight. I'm at a point with my bench where I can't add weight every week and keep going up, same with my squat, deadlift, and OHP. I have done 5x5/5x3 in the past. As long as you can keep adding weight each week, 5x5 is superior (usually for 1 year). When your gains stall, you deload, come back, and are still stalled. That's when you switch from linear progression (5x5) to wave periodization (like 531). 		0	2013-06-30T15:18:29.000Z

If you see any deadlift footage i have, i've been doing back snaps. My back is so much stronger than my glutes/hams that it takes almost all of the weight and it looks like im about to injure myself. That's why I started to do sumos and it's helped me force my hams/glutes to lift more of the weight. I might not be able to do as much weight right now, but in the long run it'll prevent injury and eventually increase weight. Maybe try sumos and see how you like them?  		0	2013-04-24T17:25:54.000Z

Did you try the work with the resistance band in my second hip mobility video? Other things it may be, just off the top of my head without seeing your squat: make sure you are keeping your lower, middle, and upper back arched hard, head up, shoulders and shoulder blades back and down, chest out. Also try pushing your knees apart on the way down so your torso can drop between your quads instead of resting on them. Let me know if any of that helps.		0	2013-03-31T13:20:54.000Z

I find it's particularly difficult to make my knees track correctly with a really narrow stance, and you seem to be experiencing this. I'd just monitor your tendencies closely (left knee tends to cave midway through the concentric) and see if you can't address them through squatting. 		0	2013-02-02T05:44:00.000Z

How much does your bar weight if it's 32mm? My hook grip has gotten way better, but my standard overhand grip has weakened considerably. And I did this cycle without a belt, so I don't feel like I can tighten everything as well as when I have a belt. That intra-abdominal pressure from forcing your abs into the belt really helps with the lifts!		0	2013-04-05T13:44:11.000Z

The ability to spread your toes out and grip the ground with your toes makes you much more stable. And I think that leads to stronger lifts--at least, it has for me and the guys I know who train in them. I think my wife found these online somewhere for like $50 or $60.		0	2012-12-31T02:57:57.000Z

I had to do some serious foam rolling (which I just started doing about two weeks ago) after that session. I find foam rolling really helps with my hip mobility and relieving tightness after squating and deadlifting. If you're not foam rolling yet, check it out, man. Once you start, you'll never go back.		0	2012-12-30T19:21:45.000Z

My training partner does front squats because his shoulder mobility is so bad he can't hold the bar on his shoulders behind his head without pain. Other than an injury preventing one or the other, I think it comes down to preference and what works for you. The weight in front shifts more pressure to the lower back, I think; and people can generally move more weight with a back squat.		0	2012-12-30T13:13:36.000Z

It just depends on your strengths (triceps vs chest) and how long your arms are. The main things for powerlifting on the bench is to set your arch as high as you can, keep your butt in contact with the bench, don't flare your elbows, bring the bar down to your lower chest (below nipples), squeeze glutes at tight as possible, and don't let your elbows drop below your body at the bottom of the movement.		0	2013-05-26T12:43:35.000Z

You just can't tell because of my shirt. In the video last week or the week before, I set up on the bench, pulled my shirt tight, and stuck my arm under me to show my arch. The only parts of me actually touching the bench are my butt and upper shoulder blades/traps. Next week, if I remember, I will set up flat and then arched to show more contrast. But look at the even curve from my knees to my throat and how high my belly is in this video.If I set up flat, chest is higher than belly.		0	2013-01-18T23:56:05.000Z

It makes sure you are not bouncing the bar off of your chest or springing with the recoil from your knees bending when the weight comes down. As long as those two things aren't happening, then no reason to pause.		0	2013-04-24T17:10:06.000Z

My sets are generally from 3 - 5 reps for heavy sets because I'm on a powerlifting routine. My assistance work is 5 sets of 10 at increasing percentages by month for a 3-month cycle: 50%, 60%, 70% of 1RM. This month my OHP for 5 sets of 10 is 90 lbs (60%) after heavy bench press. I couldn't lift last Thursday due to my dental work, but we'll see how it goes this week."		0	2013-04-24T17:04:59.000Z

Water weight and glycogen stores lost during the fast don't count. Make sure you weigh yourself at the same time every day and average your weight for the week, or just average the high and the low for the week. Your weight will be slightly off depending on when you weigh. At the end of your fast, numbers will be off due to water loss and glycogen depletion. At the start of your fast, numbers will be off due to food in your belly.		0	2013-04-24T13:54:00.000Z

The tooth underneath was fine 4 years ago. 4 years after the Army dentist put the crown back on, the tooth is decayed. He seated the crown improperly, and food was getting under it and decaying the tooth for the past four years. No way to save it. Had to get it pulled. :-(		0	2013-04-23T13:43:46.000Z

I just don't film it. And I've stopped typing it on the screen, but I always warm up with 5 reps at 40%, 5 reps @ 50%, and 3 reps @ 60%--on all four lifts. That is the 531 warm-up from the book that I have been doing for 7 months. Today was just a day when even the warm-ups felt heavy.		0	2013-06-26T13:34:42.000Z

At what weight on your squat did you start using the knee sleeves? Also, do you find them  to be effective?

With heavier weight, I drop into the hole pretty fast and start driving after I feel the stretch reflex that happens. (It doesn't happen if you go slowly, and it doesn't happen unless you go well below parallel.)		0	2013-06-01T23:36:23.000Z
